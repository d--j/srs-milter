# Required: The domain we use to generate SRS addresses
srsDomain: '__SRS_DOMAIN__'

# Required: List of secrets for SRS address generation and validation
# The first key gets used for SRS address generation. All other keys
# are only used for SRS address validation.
# You can use multiple keys for key rotation.
#srsKeys:
#  - active-key
#  - rotated-key
srsKeys: ['__SRS_KEY__']

# All domains we consider local (i.e. we do not forward but deliver locally)
# You can use IDN domain names. They will be normalized to their ASCII representation automatically.
#localDomains:
#  - 'example.net'
#  - 'example.com'

# Adjust the logging verbosity with logLevel. A logLevel of 0 (the default) only logs critical errors.
# `1` also logs normal errors. `2` also warnings. `3` informational messages and `4` also includes debug messages.
logLevel: 3

# Public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the MTA
# If the MTA is on another host or does not have public IPs (e.g. it is firewalled) you need
# to specify this list.
# If you leave this list empty we will try to determine the public IPs automatically.
#localIps:
#  - '8.8.8.8'

# Optional: You can specify a MySQL connection/query to lookup mail forwarding replacements
#dbDriver: 'mysql'
#dbDSN: 'user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname'
#dbForwardQuery: "SELECT destination from mail_forwarding WHERE source = ? AND active = 'y' AND server_id = 1;"
